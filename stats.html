        <h4> Statistics are perhaps the most important part of football tournaments - so how do computer programs help?
            <br>
            <br>
        Records range from individual players to entire leagues, and can be extremely specific or broad. These are stats that take a lot of data to store. Every single detail from leagues to individual players must be recorded. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the past, issues always arised with recorded records - a famous example being Pelé's career goal count. Pelé is arguably the best player in football history, and he technically holds the record for most goals scored in a career. The problem is, Pelé played in the mid 1900s, when statistical technology wasn't advanced yet. As a result, every time a player comes close to reaching Pelé's goal record, new "found" goals in his career appear - and cannot be disproven due to the lack of statistics for games at the time.

        Today, Computer programs record all events and games in every competitive division of football, ranging from the English Premier League to the 5th Latvian Division. </h4>
